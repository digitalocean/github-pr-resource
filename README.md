A Concourse resource for pull requests on Github. Written in Go and based on the [Github V4 (GraphQL) API][graphql-api].
Inspired by [the original][original-resource], with some important differences:

- Github V4: `check` only requires 1 API call per 100th *open* pull request. (See [#costs](#costs) for more information).
- Fetch/merge: `get` will always merge a specific commit from the Pull request into the latest base.
- Metadata: `get` and `put` provides information about which commit (SHA) was used from both the PR and base.
- Webhooks: Does not implement any caching thanks to GraphQL, which means it works well with webhooks.

## Source Configuration

| Parameter               | Required | Example                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If you want github-pr-resource to work with a private repository. Set `repo:full` permissions on the access token you create on GitHub. If it is a public repository, `repo:status` is enough. |
| `v3_endpoint`           | No       | `https://api.github.com`         | Endpoint to use for the V3 Github API (Restful).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `v4_endpoint`           | No       | `https://api.github.com/graphql` | Endpoint to use for the V4 Github API (Graphql).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `paths`                 | No       | `terraform/*/*.tf`               | Only produce new versions if the PR includes changes to files that match one or more glob patterns or prefixes.                                                                                                                                                                            |

Pattern syntax is documented in [filepath.Match](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match), or a path prefix can be specified (e.g. `.ci/` will match everything in the `.ci` directory).                                                                         |

| `git_crypt_key`         | No       | `AEdJVENSWVBUS0VZAAAAA...`       | Base64 encoded git-crypt key. Setting this will unlock / decrypt the repository with git-crypt. To get the key simply execute `git-crypt export-key -- - | base64` in an encrypted repository.                                                                                             |

Notes:
 - If `v3_endpoint` is set, `v4_endpoint` must also be set (and the other way around).
 - Look at the [Concourse Resources documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html#resource-webhook-token)
 for webhook token configuration.

## Behaviour

#### `check`

Produces new versions for all commits (after the last version) ordered by the committed date.
A version is represented as follows:

- `pr`: The pull request number.
- `commit`: The commit SHA.
- `committed`: Timestamp of when the commit was committed. Used to filter subsequent checks.

If several commits are pushed to a given PR at the same time, the last commit will be the new version.

**Note on webhooks:**
This resource does not implement any caching, so it should work well with webhooks (should be subscribed to `push` and `pull_request` events).
One thing to keep in mind however, is that pull requests that are opened from a fork and commits to said fork will not
generate notifications over the webhook. So if you have a repository with little traffic and expect pull requests from forks,
 you'll need to discover those versions with `check_every: 1m` for instance. `check` in this resource is not a costly operation,
 so normally you should not have to worry about the rate limit.

#### `get`

| Parameter       | Required | Example | Description                                                              |
|-----------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `skip_download` | No       | `true`  | Use with `get_params` in a `put` step to do nothing on the implicit get. |

Clones the base (e.g. `master` branch) at the latest commit, and merges the pull request at the specified commit
into master. This ensures that we are both testing and setting status on the exact commit that was requested in
input. Because the base of the PR is not locked to a specific commit in versions emitted from `check`, a fresh
`get` will always use the latest commit in master and *report the SHA of said commit in the metadata*. Both the
requested version and the metadata emitted by `get` are available to your tasks as JSON:
- `.git/resource/version.json`
- `.git/resource/metadata.json`

When specifying `skip_download` the pull request volume mounted to subsequent tasks will be empty, which is a problem
when you set e.g. the pending status before running the actual tests. The workaround for this is to use an alias for
the `put` (see https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource/issues/32 for more details).

git-crypt encrypted repositories will automatically be decrypted when the `git_crypt_key` is set in the source configuration.

```yaml
put: update-status <-- Use an alias for the pull-request resource
resource: pull-request
params:
    path: pull-request
    status: pending
get_params: {skip_download: true}
```

Note that, should you retrigger a build in the hopes of testing the last commit to a PR against a newer version of
the base, Concourse will reuse the volume (i.e. not trigger a new `get`) if it still exists, which can produce
unexpected results (#5). As such, re-testing a PR against a newer version of the base is best done by *pushing an
empty commit to the PR*.


#### `put`

| Parameter      | Required | Example                 | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`         | Yes      | `pull-request`          | The name given to the resource in a GET step.                                                       |
| `status`       | No       | `SUCCESS`               | Set a status on a commit. One of `SUCCESS`, `PENDING`, `FAILURE` and `ERROR`.                       |
| `context`      | No       | `unit-test`             | A context to use for the status. (Prefixed with `concourse-ci`, defaults to `concourse-ci/status`). |
| `comment`      | No       | `hello world!`          | A comment to add to the pull request.                                                               |
| `comment_file` | No       | `my-output/comment.txt` | Path to file containing a comment to add to the pull request (e.g. output of `terraform plan`).     |
| `target_url`   | No       | `ATC DEFAULT URL`       | The base URL for the Concourse deployment, used for linking to builds.                              |
| `description`  | No       | `Concourse CI build %s` | The description status on the specified pull request.                                               |

## Example

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: pull-request
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: teliaoss/github-pr-resource

resources:
- name: pull-request
  type: pull-request
  check_every: 24h
  webhook_token: ((webhook-token))
  source:
    repository: itsdalmo/test-repository
    access_token: ((github-access-token))

jobs:
- name: test
  plan:
  - get: pull-request
    trigger: true
    version: every
  - put: pull-request
    params:
      path: pull-request
      status: pending
  - task: unit-test
    config:
      platform: linux
      image_resource:
        type: docker-image
        source: {repository: alpine/git, tag: "latest"}
      inputs:
        - name: pull-request
      run:
        path: /bin/sh
        args:
          - -xce
          - |
            cd pull-request
            git log --graph --all --color --pretty=format:"%x1b[31m%h%x09%x1b[32m%d%x1b[0m%x20%s" > log.txt
            cat log.txt
    on_failure:
      put: pull-request
      params:
        path: pull-request
        status: failure
  - put: pull-request
    params:
      path: pull-request
      status: success
```

## Costs

The Github API(s) have a rate limit of 5000 requests per hour (per user). This resource will incur the following costs:

- `check`: Minimum 1, max 1 per 100th *open* pull request.
- `in`: Fixed cost of 1. Fetches the pull request at the given commit.
- `out`: Minimum 1, max 3 (1 for each of `status`, `comment` and `comment_file`).

E.g., typical use for a repository with 125 open pull requests will incur the following costs for every commit:

- `check`: 2 (paginate 125 PR's with 100 per page)
- `in`: 1 (fetch the pull request at the given commit ref)
- `out`: 1 (set status on the commit)

With a rate limit of 5000 per hour, it could handle 1250 commits between all of the 125 open pull requests in the span of that hour.

## Migrating

If you are coming from [jtarchie/github-pullrequest-resource][original-resource], its important to know that this resource is inspired by *but not a drop-in replacement for* the original. Here are some important differences:

#### New parameters:
- `source`:
  - `v4_endpoint` (see description above)
- `put`:
  - `comment` (see description above)

#### Parameters that have been renamed:
- `source`:
  - `repo` -> `repository`
  - `ci_skip` -> `disable_ci_skip` (the logic has been inverted and its `true` by default)
  - `api_endpoint` -> `v3_endpoint`
  - `base` -> `base_branch`
  - `base_url` -> `target_url`
- `put`:
  - `comment` -> `comment_file` (because we added `comment`)

#### Parameters that are no longer needed:
- `src`:
  - `uri`: We fetch the URI directly from the Github API instead.
  - `private_key`: We clone over HTTPS using the access token for authentication.
  - `username`: Same as above
  - `password`: Same as above
  - `only_mergeable`: We are opinionated and simply fail to `get` if it does not merge.
- `get`:
  - `fetch_merge`: We are opinionated and always do a fetch_merge.

#### Parameters that did not make it:
- `src`:
  - `require_review_approval`
  - `authorship_restriction`
  - `label`
  - `git_config`: You can now get the pr/author info from .git/resource/metadata.json instead
- `get`:
  - `git.*`
- `put`:
  - `merge.*`
  - `label`

Note that if you are migrating from the original resource on a Concourse version prior to `v5.0.0`, you might
see an error `failed to unmarshal request: json: unknown field "ref"`. The solution is to rename the resource
so that the history is wiped. See [#64](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource/issues/64) for details.
